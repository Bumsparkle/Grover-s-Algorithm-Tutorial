# FLIQ 2025 Algorithm Challenge Submission
# Tutorial on Grover's Algorithm - Quantum Searching with Qiskit
Written by Felix Arkle and Sebastian Gotto

## Project Overview

This project is an educational Jupyter Notebook `grovers_algorithm_tutorial.ipynb` that takes you step by step through implementing Grover's quantum search algorithm using Qiskit. It is a submission as part of FLIQ's Virtual Hackathon, included is our pitch and code files. The tutorial is aimed at people new to quantum computing and the space as a whole, with some basic python and early university level maths required. 

Our goal is to simplify quantum search algorithms by breaking down this algorithm into easily understandable components: superposition, the oracle,  and the diffuser.

## Key Learning Objectives

After you're done working through our tutorial, you will be able to:
*   Understand the problem Grover's Algorithm addresses.
*   Grasp the mathematical and theoretical concepts behind quantum superposition, phase manipulation by the oracle, and amplitude amplification via the diffuser.
*   Construct each part of Grover's algorithm from the ground up in Qiskit.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Jupyter Notebook `pip install notebook`
*   Qiskit `pip install qiskit qiskit-aer`
*   Matplotlib `pip install matplotlib`
*   NumPy `pip install numpy`
*   IPython display utilities `pip install ipython`
*   (Optional, for running on IBM Quantum hardware: `qiskit-ibm-provider` and an IBM Quantum API token)

## Running the Tutorial Notebook

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Open the `grovers_algorithm_tutorial.ipynb` file.
3.  Follow the instructions and run the code cells sequentially.
